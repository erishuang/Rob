This is for gree robot demo.

It contains a server file and an App file. There are three demos for servers, one is for modbus communication and the other two are for App commnunication.

To start up, download the App apk file in an Android phone, running the server by running the Appserver file.

The server may need to use pip to install flask and modbus package.

If there are package missing, on windows run:   pip install flask/pip install **(on your own)

If the App crashes, it might because of the IP address changed. Check for the current Ip address by running: ipconfig 

and change the IP on APP's code.
